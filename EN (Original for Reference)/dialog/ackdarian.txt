GREETING_NEUTRAL			;How can we help you?
GREETING_ANGRY				;You try our patience. Make your point quickly

OFFER_FREETRADE				;We recommend a Free Trade Agreement between our empires.\n\nJust think of all that Nepthys wine and Ucantium pearl you can trade with us!\n\nAre you tempted?
FREETRADE_ACCEPT			;A grand idea! We accept your offer of a Free Trade Agreement.\n\nLong live our alliance!
FREETRADE_REJECT			;No, we reject a Free Trade Agreement with you at this time.\n\nPossibly later though, we'll have to see about that

CANCELTREATY				;We can no longer support our {0} with you. So we are ending this treaty now.\n\nWe wish you well
CANCELTREATY_RESPONSE_FRIENDLY		;This is unexpected to us!\n\nWe don't really understand your actions here, but we respect your decision
CANCELTREATY_RESPONSE_NEUTRAL		;When treaties no longer work, we should face these issues openly.\n\nThank you for your honesty here
CANCELTREATY_RESPONSE_ANGRY		;We concur with your evaluation.\n\nThis treaty no longer meets our needs either. It is best to end it

TREATY_PROPOSAL				;What kind of change do you have in mind?
TREATY_ACCEPTRESPONSE			;An excellent outcome! We rejoice with our new allies.\n\nWould you like some Nepthys wine?
TREATY_REJECTRESPONSE			;Are you sure we cannot change your mind?\n\nMaybe you will reconsider it some time in the future

TRADESANCTIONS_IMPOSE			;We do not undertake this course lightly, but we must now impose Trade Sanctions on you.\n\nWe hope that we do not need to take things further than this
TRADESANCTIONS_IMPOSE_RESPONSE_ANGRY	;We are angered by your hasty imposition of Trade Sanctions!\n\nWe will respond quickly to protect our interests
TRADESANCTIONS_IMPOSE_RESPONSE_NEUTRAL	;You like playing tough, huh? We can do that too, you know.\n\nNo more Nepthys wine for you!
TRADESANCTIONS_IMPOSE_RESPONSE_SURPRISED	;Your actions make no sense to us. We see no need for Trade Sanctions
TRADESANCTIONS_LIFT			;Our Trade Sanctions against you have served their purpose.\n\nWe are now lifting them
TRADESANCTIONS_LIFT_RESPONSE		;Very well. We will also resume trade with you.\n\nHow about some Nepthys wine to celebrate?

WAR_DECLARE				;You leave us with no choice: we declare WAR on you!\n\nOur justice will be quick, decisive and permanent
WAR_DECLARE_RESPONSE_EAGER		;War on us? Huh! We will give you a lesson in war.\n\nWe do not fear you
WAR_DECLARE_RESPONSE_NEUTRAL		;You have chosen this course, and we will respond.\n\nPrepare your defenses!
WAR_DECLARE_RESPONSE_SURPRISED		;Are you in the habit of attacking your friends? Your behaviour is very strange.\n\nBe warned that we will defend ourselves!

WAR_END					;This war has continued long enough. We suggest a ceasefire is in order.\n\nDo you agree?
WAR_END_ACCEPT				;Yes, a ceasefire would be agreeable.\n\nWe are pulling back our forces now
WAR_END_REJECT				;No, we intend to see this war to its finish.\n\nYour aggression has no place in this galaxy

GIFT_GIVE				;We offer you this gift of {0} credits.\n\nPerhaps you could spend some of it on our fine Ucantium pearls?

WARNING_INTELLIGENCEMISSIONS		;We have intercepted your covert missions against us. This must stop now.\n\nYou have been warned!
WARNING_ATTACKS				;We are very upset by your ship attacks against us.\n\nStop them at once, or we will take punitive action against you!

WARNING						;This sounds serious. Please explain the matter to us
WARNING_INTELLIGENCEMISSIONS_RESPONSE_FRIENDLY	;Covert missions? Consider them finished.\n\nWe will not bother you again
WARNING_INTELLIGENCEMISSIONS_RESPONSE_NEUTRAL	;Yes, we understand. We will ensure that we don't get caught again.\n\nIs there anything else?
WARNING_INTELLIGENCEMISSIONS_RESPONSE_ANGRY	;We have no idea what you're talking about.\n\nAnd we do not intend to discuss this matter any further
WARNING_ATTACKS_RESPONSE_FRIENDLY		;We must apologize, friend. Our border sentries must have become overzealous.\n\nWe will correct this situation
WARNING_ATTACKS_RESPONSE_NEUTRAL		;We agree that this is most unhelpful.\n\nWe will deal with the starship captains involved in this incident
WARNING_ATTACKS_RESPONSE_ANGRY			;Attacks on your ships?\n\nLet me be honest with you: we find your empire to be quite worrisome. I wouldn't be surprised if one of our starship captains got a little trigger-happy.\n\nMaybe you should sort out your own starship commanders first, before complaining to us
