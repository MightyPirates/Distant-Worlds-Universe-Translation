GREETING_INTRODUCTION			;Good day. We are the {0}.\n\nOur culture is superior to all others.\n\nYou may admire our greatness and marvel at our achievements
GREETING_FRIENDLY			;What trivial thought do you wish to share with us, friend?
GREETING_NEUTRAL			;We are ready to hear your frivolous ideas.\n\nYou may now speak
GREETING_ANGRY				;Say your silly speech quickly!

OFFER_FREETRADE				;You would benefit greatly in a Free Trade Agreement with us! But best of all, we would make a lot of money too.\n\nWhat do you say?
FREETRADE_ACCEPT			;A Free Trade Agreement is an excellent idea.\n\nWe forsee great profit - mostly for us!
FREETRADE_REJECT			;Sorry, a Free Trade Agreement with you wouldn't be worth it.\n\nYou're just too poor

CANCELTREATY				;This {0} is over. Goodbye
CANCELTREATY_RESPONSE_FRIENDLY		;Well, that is... surprising. Err, will you reconsider?
CANCELTREATY_RESPONSE_NEUTRAL		;No more treaty? How sad.\n\nOf course, on the bright side, we will be charging you a hefty cancellation fee
CANCELTREATY_RESPONSE_ANGRY		;How outrageous! After all we have done for you, after listening to all your boring speeches, and most of all: after spending all that money!

TREATY_PROPOSAL				;A treaty proposal! Tell us what it is!\n\nDoes it involve lots of money?
TREATY_ACCEPTRESPONSE			;How glorious! We forsee this mutually beneficial relationship making us both very rich - especially us
TREATY_REJECTRESPONSE			;You are rejecting our treaty offer?!\n\nThis cannot be right. Did you not understand our offer?

TRADESANCTIONS_IMPOSE			;Effective immediately, we are imposing Trade Sanctions against you!\n\nLet's see how you survive without our trade!
TRADESANCTIONS_IMPOSE_RESPONSE_ANGRY	;How dare you even consider terminating trade with us!\n\nIt is... simply, um, er... not fair!
TRADESANCTIONS_IMPOSE_RESPONSE_NEUTRAL	;How foolish of you to think that Trade Sanctions will hurt us.\n\nGood riddance to your trade!
TRADESANCTIONS_IMPOSE_RESPONSE_SURPRISED	;Trade Sanctions?! Don't you mean trade BONUSES? Surely you meant that...
TRADESANCTIONS_LIFT			;We are ending our Trade Sanctions against you.\n\nAlthough we despise your inferior civilization, there is one thing that we like about you - your money
TRADESANCTIONS_LIFT_RESPONSE		;Resuming trade is a wise decision.\n\nMoney is so much more important than anything else, don't you think?

WAR_DECLARE				;It is our great pleasure to declare War on your primitive empire!
WAR_DECLARE_RESPONSE_EAGER		;YOU attacking US?! We are laughing so hard that we cannot breathe.\n\nPrepare to taste defeat!

WAR_DECLARE_RESPONSE_NEUTRAL		;How unfair. We hate wars - they're so expensive!
WAR_DECLARE_RESPONSE_SURPRISED		;There must be some mistake! What did we do to offend you?! Aren't we friends any more?

WAR_END					;We have spent enough on this war - let's end it now. Is it a deal?
WAR_END_ACCEPT				;Agreed, we will end this war immediately - it has cost far too much already!

WAR_END_REJECT				;No, this war should continue until either we win or you lose

GIFT_GIVE				;We present you with a gift of {0} credits.\n\nDon't forget: for stingy misers like us to willingly part with this money means that we must really like you!
GIFT_THANKS				;Thank you for your gift of distinction: money!\n\nNext time, we would be happy to accept even larger amounts. Just wanted to make sure you knew that...

WARNING_INTELLIGENCEMISSIONS		;We have uncovered your treacherous covert missions against us!\n\nStop them now you naughty alien, or we will get very angry and do something very scary!
WARNING_ATTACKS				;Stop attacking our ships and bases!\n\nIf you don't stop we are going to call you rude names! Or even worse!

WARNING						;A warning for us?\n\nWell, don't keep us in suspense! Please share your concern
WARNING_INTELLIGENCEMISSIONS_RESPONSE_FRIENDLY	;This is news to us. We did not order these missions against you.\n\nWe will check things for you and get to the bottom of this situation
WARNING_INTELLIGENCEMISSIONS_RESPONSE_NEUTRAL	;Covert missions?\n\nYou must be mistaken? Or possibly just paranoid?
WARNING_INTELLIGENCEMISSIONS_RESPONSE_ANGRY	;Missions against you? No, we don't think this really happened.\n\nAnyway, we don't recall anything about these particular missions you're talking about here
WARNING_ATTACKS_RESPONSE_FRIENDLY		;Well, you know how it is: sometimes those starship commanders just get a bit excited!\n\nWe'll have a talk to them. It shouldn't happen again
WARNING_ATTACKS_RESPONSE_NEUTRAL		;Do you expect some sort of compensation?\n\nIf so, then we know nothing about these missions...
WARNING_ATTACKS_RESPONSE_ANGRY			;We tell you candidly: we are tired of your primitive species.\n\nTarget practice on your ships relieves some of our frustration
