You can monitor diplomatic relations from the Diplomacy screen (F5 key)

Trade Sanctions & Blockades
Trade Sanctions & Blockades
Trade sanctions are where an empire refuses to trade with another empire. No resources will be bought or sold between the two empires.

When trade sanctions exist between two empires, blockades may be declared against enemy colonies and space ports. In this situation no trade by ANY empire is permitted with the blockaded colony or base. Blockades are enforced by military ships from the initiating empire.

See the Galactopedia (F1) for more information on initiating blockades.
