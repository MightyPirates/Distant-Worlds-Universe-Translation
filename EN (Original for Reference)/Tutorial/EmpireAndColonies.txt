State vs Private
State vs Private
Your empire is divided into two sections:
- State: the portion you control
- Private: your private citizens who go about their own business without your help

Note that you only control the State portion of your empire. You have no direct control of your private citizens activities.

Private Citizens
Private Citizens
Your private citizens go about their own business, improving their colonies.

This means that they trade goods, transport cargo and mine resources - all without any intervention from you.

State Activities
State Activities
The state portion of your empire has four basic tasks:
- Exploring the galaxy
- Colonizing new planets
- Constructing new ships
- Defending your empire

Government Style
Government Style
Each empire follows a particular style of government. Each government type has specific advantages and disadvantages.

You can change your government style by having a revolution. But there are negative side effects from revolution, including a temporary setback of development at your colonies.

State Income
State Income
Money is critical to fund your empire. Your state economy derives income from four areas:
- colony taxes
- transaction fees at your space ports
- purchases of new ships by your private citizens
- bonuses from trade with other empires

Colonies
Colonies
Let's take a look at the colonized planets in your empire.

Colonies are the heart of your empire. When you lose all of your colonies, you lose the game.

Colonies - Tax
Colonies - Tax
Colonies produce wealth. Your empire's main revenue comes from taxing colonies.

By default colony tax levels are controlled automatically, but you can alter each colony tax rate directly if you prefer.

Colonies - Growth
Colonies - Growth
Colonies grow in two ways: population and development level

Population: grows over time until it reaches a maximum level for the planet.

Development Level: when a colony receives a steady supply of luxury resources its general development level grows. Higher development level means more wealth and thus more tax revenue.

Population Indicator

The population size and development level of a colony is indicated by the graph displayed in the colony's name badge.

The horizontal axis indicates the population size. The vertical axis relates to the development level.
