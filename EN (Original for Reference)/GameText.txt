Of course we would await your order before commencing the actual attack.\n\nShould we initiate our preparations for the attack?
Automation Raid		;Our diplomats and military advisors are concerned about our rival, the {0}.

Automation Bombard Colony		;Our military advisors recommend that we bombard the {0} {1} {2}, a colony of our enemy the {3} in the {4} system.\n\nBombarding the colony would wipe out the population there and damage the quality of the {1} itself.

'STORY CLUES
SecondaryStoryClue1		;They say that their ancient ancestors were once a space-faring race, travelling between the stars. But that knowledge was lost in a terrible disaster they refer to as the 'Great Forgetting'.
SecondaryStoryClue2		;They tell of a time in the distant past when the galaxy was enslaved by a cruel alien race. However these evil tyrants suddenly disappeared, never to be seen again. Ever since that time, they have lived in fear that these cruel overlords will one day return.
SecondaryStoryClue3		;They tell of a time in the distant past when gigantic monsters would descend from the sky to consume entire cities. These monsters destroyed all in their path, wiping out most of their civilization. Ever since then they have lived in fear that these terrifying creatures will one day return.
SecondaryStoryClue4		;They say that their ancestors lived in a time of great knowledge, with technology far beyond their own. But their civilization crumbled when a deadly plague struck their planet, killing most of the population.
SecondaryStoryClue5		;The message appears to be a progress report on a mammoth construction project:\n\n========================================\nPROGRESS REPORT - PROJECT DESOLATION\n\nConstruction work on our colossal project has been proceeding steadily. Despite encountering numerous technical problems we have been able to overcome them all - we remain on schedule.\n\nIt has proven especially difficult to maintain secrecy for our supply convoys. The quantity of materials they ferry to the construction site is enormous. But our recent takeover of the nearby Judan system has largely resolved this problem.\n\nWhen our new superweapon is revealed our enemies will tremble before us!\n========================================
SecondaryStoryClue6		;The message appears to be a news broadcast warning of an impending enemy invasion:\n\n========================================\nFTL INTERSECTOR NEWS - EMERGENCY BROADCAST\n\nThis is an emergency message to the inhabitants of Osidian 4. The Shakturi Axis has launched a surprise attack in our system. Shakturi forces are battling with the 3rd Alliance fleet in orbit over Osidian 4 at this very moment.\n\nGovernor Duroshi has ordered the immediate evacuation of all Alliance citizens from the planet. Evacuation transports will be leaving for multiple refuge destinations. Make your way to the nearest departure point at once!\n========================================
SecondaryStoryClue7		;The message appears to be a mission briefing to a military task force:\n\n========================================\nMISSION BRIEFING - ALLIANCE TASK FORCE 84\n\nYour mission is to transport your consignment of Giant Kaltors to the Fodoras system. This system contains an important Shakturi shipyard that must be destroyed.\n\nOnce at your destination, release all of your consignment as close as possible to the planet Fodoras 8. Opposition may be intense, but it is critical that your payload reach its target.\n\nOnce you have completed this task make your way to the refuelling outpost at Lopas 12 and await further orders. Good luck.\n========================================
SecondaryStoryClue8		;The message appears to be a distress signal from a damaged warship:\n\n========================================\nDISTRESS CODE 99 - SHAKTURI 5TH FLEET\n\nOur ship, the 'Dark Reaper', is the only surviving ship of the 5th fleet. We are fleeing the scene of battle in the Montur system.\n\nOur fleet was ambushed by an immense swarm of savage space creatures. The monstrous creatures attacked our ships, devouring everything! We are returning to Shaktur fleet headquarters directly.\n\nOn board we also have many crew stricken with an unusual illness. Dr Torzhan has examined them but has not seen symptoms like these before. Please make ready emergency medical teams to treat the affected crew members on our arrival.\n========================================
SecondaryStoryClue9		;It appears to be a time capsule message from an alien race decimated by a deadly plague:\n\n========================================\nPRESERVATION OF KNOWLEDGE\n\nThe Xaraktor virus has massacred our population. Everything is chaos. Giant Kaltors continue their attacks. The remnants of our population has mostly resorted to lawless anarchy and rioting. Our civilization is disintegrating before our eyes - very few of us remain now.\n\nWe have undertaken a last ditch effort to preserve all of our culture, knowledge and technology. It is our hope that even if none of us survive this catastrophic plague, at least all of our collective knowledge will endure. Maybe at some time in the distant future it will be discovered by some worthy explorer.\n\n

We should proceed with extreme caution in any dealings with them - they are totally untrustworthy.\n\nThe Shakturi clearly intend to dominate all around them. They demonstrate utter contempt for their neighbours. Their treatment of the Atuukian Kingdom is a prime example of their brutality.\n\nWe strongly suspect that the Shakturi are secretly working to overthrow all of the empires in their region. What their subsequent objective is remains unclear at this stage.\n========================================
StoryClue2		;The message appears to be a secret intelligence report describing an empire's success in covertly undermining and dividing its enemies:\n\n========================================\nSHAKTUR AXIS INTELLIGENCE REPORT\n\nOur ongoing efforts to divide the pitiful, backward peoples of the galaxy are having great success. We have now infiltrated every empire and are progressively working to undermine their feeble alliances.\n\nThe ancient Karatur Unity Pact was shattered by our recent deception, where we framed the Goltak Republic for the genocide at Volindra 7. It was priceless to watch their astonished denials!\n\nHowever one notable failure in our diplomatic sabotage plans has been the recent formation of the Freedom Alliance. This new alliance is a serious threat to our aims - the Humans, Kiadians and Ackdarians form a potent combination of strength and intelligence. However even they are compromised - nothing they do is unknown to us.\n\nWhen we commence our attack, revealing all of our secrets, nothing will stop us...\n========================================
StoryClue3		;The message appears to be an archived news broadcast reporting on an intense battle in a major galactic war:\n\n========================================\nFTL INTERSECTOR NEWS - BREAKING\n\nReports are reaching us of a catastrophic loss in the battle against the Shaktur Axis.\n\nFreedom Alliance forces described a shocking new development while defending the Rekallios system. During the battle the Shakturis unleashed a new superweapon that completely destroyed the planet Rekallios 5, leaving behind only a rocky field of space debris. This deadly planet destroyer weapon came as a total surprise - the Alliance forces were left with no option but to flee.\n\nThe loss in the Rekallios system is an especially bitter blow to the Freedom Alliance, following a series of disastrous defeats in the surrounding systems. In the few months since it began its conquest, the Shaktur Axis has taken control of more than 20 sectors. The intensity of the Shakturi onslaught is proving overwhelming for the over-stretched Alliance forces.\n\nAdmiral Kandulian, supreme commander of Freedom Alliance forces, has instructed colony governors in the Alliance core worlds to commence emergency evacuations.\n========================================
StoryClue4		;The message appears to be a classified report on top secret military research projects:\n\n========================================\nFREEDOM ALLIANCE SECRET WEAPONS RESEARCH REPORT\n\nAs you are all well aware, our losses to the Shaktur Axis have been breathtaking. It is projected that in a few more months we will be completely overrun. In light of this desperate situation, several months ago Alliance high command approved our research projects for the ultimate doomsday option to stop the Shakturi. This report outlines our progress and current status.\n\nOur research projects have proceeded along two paths:\n1. a virus bioweapon that targets the Shakturi genetic structure\n2. a genetically modified space creature capable of spreading the virus\n\nOur bioengineering project is progressing well - the common Kaltor has been genetically modified into a giant space-going predator. This new Giant Kaltor should prove to be an excellent vector for spreading our super virus.\n\nOn the other hand, work on the super virus itself has been difficult. While we have successfully developed an incredibly lethal virus, it has proven extremely complex to ensure that it solely targets only the Shakturi species. Our current iteration of the virus is 100% lethal against Shakturi. However it is also 70% lethal against most other species. We believe that we can reduce the lethality to other species to just 5% with another six months of work.\n\nHigh command has communicated the dire urgency of these deadly weapons, but we have grave fears for the consequences of unleashing them before they are ready.\n========================================
StoryClue5		;It appears to be a final transmission from a heavily damaged capital ship. The message describes the outcome of a cataclysmic war in the galaxy:\n\n========================================\nLAST MESSAGE TO SURVIVORS\nFreedom Alliance vessel 'Guardian of Freedom', command ship 8th Fleet, Stardate 9876.07.30\n\nThis is a final message to any surviving Freedom Alliance forces and our allies. Our main reactor is failing and we are undertaking a mass evacuation to a marginally habitable planet here in the Torak system.\n\nThe great conflict is finally over, but at enormous cost. The deadly Xaraktor virus succeeded beyond anyone's imagination, stopping the Shakturi dead in their tracks. As far as we can tell, no Shaktur Axis forces remain anywhere.\n\nUnfortunately the virus also destroyed nearly all other life in the galaxy. Once out in the wild it mutated at alarming speed, wiping out nearly everything it touched. We believe that the virus has now burnt itself out - it can only live for a few weeks in a single host. However the Giant Kaltors are still rampant, making travel through many systems extremely hazardous.\n\nWe have had no contact with anyone for several weeks. It is possible that some pockets of civilization may have survived, but we do not hold out much hope. To any recipients of this message - we wish you well. May stellar civilization rise once again some day in the far distant future...\n========================================

MajorStoryEvent1		;The dark ones of ancient times long to return. They seek a pathway back, to dominate over all.\n\nBeware of unknown monuments and beacons that light the way.\n\nBe prepared for the revenge of the destroyers...
MajorStoryEvent2		;A deep evil creeps across the void.\n\nDarkness overshadows the stars.\n\nAll will be lost, none will remain,... unless deliverance can be found...
MajorStoryEvent3		;We are the guardians of secrets from the ancient past. At this critical time we share this most important message with you:\n\nWe have finally confirmed what we have long suspected: the Erutkah are not who they claim to be. Through our covert channels we have discovered that the ERUTKAH are actually the SHAKTURI of ancient legend!\n\nUnder the false pretense of being refugees from another galaxy, the Shakturi have been secretly sending huge convoys of powerful military ships into our galaxy. This is nothing less than a stealth invasion!\n\nYou probably know that the Shakturi have visited our galaxy before. Thousands of years ago they invaded our galaxy: dividing, destroying and dominating. Their strength was unmatched, and despite the heroic efforts of the ancient Freedom Alliance, the Shakturi were on the brink of total victory and domination over all.\n\nAt this time the allied races of the Humans, Kiadians and Ackdarians launched a desperate last-ditch attempt to stop the Shakturi: they developed a devastating biological weapon known as the Xaraktor virus. Along with this, the Alliance also bio-engineered the Giant Kaltor space monster to spread this deadly virus.\n\nThe Xaraktor virus was 100% lethal to the Shakturi. Unfortunately, despite the best efforts of Alliance scientists, it was also quite deadly to most other species. When the virus was unleashed against the Shakturi, the results were catastrophic – the Shakturi were totally wiped out within weeks.\n\nBut the rest of the galaxy was also shattered: all space-faring empires were ravaged by the virus, with anarchy soon overtaking them – their civilizations disintegrated and they returned to primitive ways.\n\nThe Alliance knew that the Shakturi were cunning adversaries who would very likely leave behind beacons to notify their race in their distant home galaxy when the time had arrived for a new invasion, far in the future.\n\nForeseeing this likely situation, the Alliance made preparations to preserve important technology and weaponry here on our planet of Utopia. As guardians of these ancient secrets, we have waited and watched. Now the time has come to turn these tools over to you. You must unite with your allies of old and defeat the Shakturi!\n\nWe have already communicated with the other races of the ancient grand alliance and prepared them for what is to come. With your approval we will reactivate the Freedom Alliance and present you with a powerful fleet that you will need to battle the Shakturi.\n\nThe planet of Utopia must be protected at all costs. Important relics from the past reside here, and they are critical to the future of the galaxy. Do not let the Shakturi destroy or defeat Utopia! It must stand...
MajorStoryEvent4		;Our deceptive claim of being the peaceful 'Erutkah' fooled most of the galaxy! But now we drop our mask and fight openly as the Shaktur Supremacy.\n\nAnd once again we face the Freedom Alliance! But you cannot possibly win - our burning fury will consume you! This time you will not thwart our rightful dominance of this galaxy.\n\nDo not hope to destroy us again with your Xaraktor virus. We have learnt from that failure and have developed a very effective vaccine against it.\n\nThe Ancient Guardians cannot save you either. Their powerful secrets will not survive our onslaught.\n\nOur forces have only just begun to flow across the dark void from our home galaxy to this galaxy. You will soon experience our full rage when we unleash unequalled destruction on your pitiful empires!\n\nOur new World Destroyers have just arrived in the galaxy and are fully operational. We cannot wait to crush those meddlesome Mechanoids and their home planet of Utopia!\n\nWith the Freedom Alliance destroyed, nothing will stop us from ruling over all!\n\nWelcome to your end...
MajorStoryEvent5		;As you are well aware, our losses to the Shaktur Supremacy have been breathtaking. In a short while we will be completely overrun.\n\nIn light of this desperate situation it is time to reveal a secret that we have kept from you until now.\n\nLong ago when the Shakturi first roamed this galaxy the ancients created us - the Mechanoids - as the last preserve of knowledge and hope. Our directive was to be keepers of all wisdom from the past and to watch for the return of the Shakturi. The ancients knew that at some future time the Shakturi would return and again attempt to dominate this galaxy. Thus we have reassembled the Freedom Alliance and armed you with the Guardian Fleet.\n\nHowever the ancients also left us with tools of last resort, to be used when all appeared lost. With the dire threat we now face, it is time to deliver these tools for your use against the Shakturi.\n\nIn orbit around your capital you will now find the planet destroyer 'Deliverance'. This is an especially powerful Shakturi planet destroyer that was captured by the ancient Freedom Alliance after they defeated the Shakturi long ago. It has been kept safely hidden for thousands of years, but now the time has come to use it.\n\nMay it successfully defeat the evil Shakturi...

ShakturiPlayerVictory		;The Shakturi have been defeated! Their capital is no more.\n\nWith the loss of their central command the Shakturi empire has fallen into confusion and chaos. Most of their forces have disbanded, with many attempting to flee back across the void to their home galaxy. What little remains of the once-mighty Shakturi empire have given up the fight.\n\n\nThe Ancient Guardians share a final message with you:\n\nOur mission is complete: the galaxy has been saved from the Shakturi return! Your actions in defeating the Shakturi have shown you to be worthy inheritors of the ancient legacy. With our purpose fulfilled, we appoint you as the new galactic guardians.\n\nWe present to you our planet Utopia and all of our ships and bases. Along with this we give you all of our technical knowledge and galactic map information. We also share with with you knowledge of our wise and benevolent form of government: The Way of the Ancients. May you use these wisely in defending the galaxy.\n\n\nYou are victorious! Long live the Freedom Alliance!
ShakturiPlayerDefeat		;You have been defeated by the mighty Shakturi! The guardian capital of Utopia has fallen!\n\nThe colonies of your empire still remain free. But without the help of the Ancient Guardians, the Shakturi domination over all is now inevitable.\n\nDarkness falls across the galaxy, all hope is lost - how did you let this happen?!...

Troop Type Description Infantry		;The basic troop unit. Provides strong defense against invasion.
Troop Type Description Armored		;Provides very strong attack for invading enemy colonies. Armored forces must be produced at an Armored Factory planetary facility, built at one of your colonies. Armored forces are twice the size of Infantry, and thus require more space on your Troop Transports.
Troop Type Description Artillery		;Reduces the strength of invading enemy troops. Planetary Defense Units fire at invading enemy troops as they drop to the surface from their transports. Planetary Defense Units are 4 times the size of Infantry, and thus require more space on your Troop Transports.
Troop Type Description SpecialForces		;Take out enemy defensive facilities and bases prior to invading an enemy colony. Special Forces have a much better chance of successfully landing on the target colony (i.e. bypassing defenses like planetary shields, etc). They target defensive facilities for destruction: fortified bunkers, planetary shields, giant ion cannons, etc. Special Forces are very tough and hard to destroy - they are best countered by enemy Special Forces.
