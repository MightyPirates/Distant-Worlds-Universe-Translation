Fleets
Fleets
Fleets allow you to group a number of military ships together and assign missions to the entire group. This is useful for coordinating large attacks on enemy targets.
~
Fleets - Assigning Ships
Fleets - Assigning Ships
You can assign any of your military ships to a fleet by selecting them, then right-clicking on them to display the mission popup menu. Select "Join Fleet" from the menu and then select which fleet you want to join in the submenu.

From the submenu you can also create a new fleet with the selected ship as the first ship in the fleet.

Fleets - Appearance
Fleets - Appearance
When you are zoomed out to system level, fleets appear as an inverted triangle icon.

The number of ships in the fleet is displayed inside the triangle symbol.
~
Fleets - Selecting
Fleets - Selecting
To select one of your fleets, just double-click any ship in the fleet.

Fleets are managed from the Fleets screen (F12 key).

Troops
Troops
Troops defend your colonies against invasion by enemy empires. They can also be used as attacking forces to invade and take over enemy colonies.
~
Troops - Recruiting
Troops - Recruiting
Troops are recruited at your colonies. They cost money to maintain, so only recruit troops that you really need.

You can recruit troops from the Troops tab of the Colonies screen (F2 key).

You can also right-click on any of your colonies in the main view to recruit them from the popup menu.
~
Troops - Transporting
Troops - Transporting
Troops can be loaded onto ships that have troop storage components, such as troop transports or larger military ships. They can then be sent to another colony and unloaded there to reinforce it. Or they can be used as an invasion force at an enemy colony.

The troops in your empire can be managed from the Troops screen.
~
Intelligence Missions
Intelligence Missions
Intelligence missions enable you to secretly infiltrate other empires and steal or destroy their assets.

Intelligence agents are the highly-trained and skilled specialists that you use to accomplish these missions.

Your agents can be managed from the Characters screen (F4 key).
~
Assigning missions
Assigning missions
The Mission summary panel at the bottom-right of the screen allows you to assign missions to agents.

Select a target empire for the mission and a mission type.

The more time you allow for the mission, the greater the chance of success.
~
Counter Intelligence
Counter Intelligence
Counter intelligence is also critical to protect your empire. You can assign agents to prevent enemy intelligence missions - they will actively seek out spies and saboteurs and report any discoveries to you.

Beware of the negative fallout from botched intelligence missions - if another empire discovers your actions against them it will dramatically lower their estimation of your empire, and could even lead to war.
