Introduction
Introduction
Distant Worlds is a complex game, but the goal is simple: build and maintain a galactic empire.

In the game you focus on 4 key areas:
- Explore the galaxy
- Colonize new planets
- Extract valuable resources
- Defend your empire
~
The Galaxy
The Galaxy
The Galaxy is a big place - it's packed with new worlds to find, alien races to discover and resources to exploit.

Let's take a look at how you can move around the galaxy.
~
Moving Around
Moving Around
The main view shows a portion of the galaxy - in this case a small portion of one star system near one of your colony planets.

Move the mouse pointer to the edge of the screen to scroll the main view up, down, left or right. You can also use the arrow keys on your keyboard to do the same thing.

You can also drag the main view by holding down the right mouse button.
~
Moving Around - Zooming
Moving Around - Zooming
You can also zoom the main view in or out to see more or less of the galaxy.

Use the mouse scroll wheel to zoom the main view in or out. You can also use the PageUp and PageDown keys to do the same thing.
~
Zoom buttons
Zoom buttons
The ZoomIn and ZoomOut buttons on the main screen also allow you to zoom in or out.
~
System view
System view
When zoomed out to system level you can identify the colonies and ships for an empire by the empire's main color.

You can zoom in to any location by holding down the 'Ctrl' key while clicking.
~
Sector view
Sector view
As you zoom out further the main view changes to show systems.

At this level ships and bases are shown as icons. The icon color indicates which empire the ship or base belongs to.
~
Explored Systems
Explored Systems
Systems that you have explored have their names displayed next to them.
~
Unexplored Systems
Unexplored Systems
Systems that you have not yet explored have no name displayed next to them.
~
Colonized Systems
Colonized Systems
Systems that have been colonized by an empire are circled with their empire's color.

The size of the circle indicates the system's relative importance - larger systems are more valuable.
~
Empire Territory
Empire Territory
Systems that are part of an empire's territory have a colored background.

A system can be owned by an empire even when it is not colonized.

Colonies project their empire's influence into nearby systems, making them part of their empire's territory.
~
Independent Systems
Independent Systems
Some systems have independent colonies of aliens that do not belong to any empire.

These independent systems are circled with a solid grey line.

They can be good targets for your empire to colonize - the aliens provide a critical boost to the population of your new colony, allowing it to quickly start earning income for your empire.
~
Systems with Potential Colonies
Systems with Potential Colonies
Any systems with potential colonies are indicated by a dashed grey circle.

Build a new colony ship and send it to these uninhabited planets to establish a new colony for your empire.
~

~
Your Empire
Your Empire
Now let's get an overview of your empire.

You can view a summary of your empire from the Empire Summary screen (F6). Click the Empire Summary button to show this screen.
~
State vs Private
State vs Private
Your empire is divided into two sections:
- State: the portion you control
- Private: your private citizens who go about their own business without your help

Note that you only control the State portion of your empire. You have no direct control of your private citizens activities.
~
Private Citizens
Private Citizens
Your private citizens go about their own business, improving their colonies.

This means that they trade goods, transport cargo and mine resources - all without any intervention from you.
~
State Activities
State Activities
The state portion of your empire has four basic tasks:
- Exploring the galaxy
- Colonizing new planets
- Constructing new ships
- Defending your empire
~
Government Style
Government Style
Each empire follows a particular style of government. Each government type has specific advantages and disadvantages.

You can change your government style by having a revolution. But there are negative side effects from revolution, including a temporary setback of development at your colonies.
~
State Income
State Income
Money is critical to fund your empire. Your state economy derives income from four areas:
- colony taxes
- transaction fees at your space ports
- purchases of new ships by your private citizens
- bonuses from trade with other empires
~
Colonies
Colonies
Let's take a look at the colonized planets in your empire.

Colonies are the heart of your empire. When you lose all of your colonies, you lose the game.
~
Colonies - Tax
Colonies - Tax
Colonies produce wealth. Your empire's main revenue comes from taxing colonies.

By default colony tax levels are controlled automatically, but you can alter each colony tax rate directly if you prefer.
~
Colonies - Growth
Colonies - Growth
Colonies grow in two ways: population and development level

Population: grows over time until it reaches a maximum level for the planet.

Development Level: when a colony receives a steady supply of luxury resources its general development level grows. Higher development level means more wealth and thus more tax revenue.
~
Population Indicator
Population Indicator
The population size and development level of a colony is indicated by the graph displayed in the colony's name badge.

The horizontal axis indicates the population size. The vertical axis relates to the development level.
~
Empire and Capital
Empire and Capital
The empire owning a colony is indicated by the color of the surrounding circle and name badge. If the colony is the empire capital a gold star also appears to the left of the name.
~
Dominant Race
Dominant Race
The dominant alien race at the colony is displayed at the bottom of the name badge.
~
Resources
Resources
The natural resources present at the colony are also displayed at the bottom of the name badge.

These resources at your colonies are automatically mined and then used, either to build things or to be sold.
~
Colony List

Ships and Bases
Ships and Bases
Now let's take a look at ships and bases.

Ships travel throughout the galaxy performing a wide range of tasks, from transporting cargo to defending your empire.

Bases are fixed platforms in space, usually located at a planet.

To see a complete list of all the ships and bases in your empire click the Ships and Bases button (F11 key).
~
Ships and Bases - Designing
Ships and Bases - Designing
All your empire's ships and bases can be designed to your exact specifications in the Designs screen (F8 key).

See the Advanced tutorial for more information on how to do this.
~
Assigning Missions
Assigning Missions
You can assign missions to any state-owned ship or base in your empire.

However this does NOT include privately-owned ships like freighters, mining ships or mining stations. You have no control over these privately-owned ships and bases. They go about their business automatically, selecting missions for themselves.
~
Assigning a Mission
Assigning a Mission
To assign a mission to a ship first select it in the main view by left-clicking on it with the mouse.

Then right-click the mouse over the mission target, e.g. to make a ship move to another location right-click the mouse at that location.

Note that you may need to unpause the game to see the ship move.
~
Missions - Popup Menu
Missions - Popup Menu
Right-clicking on the ship or base may also bring up a popup menu listing a number of missions.

These missions are specific to the particular type of ship or base. They may include: Exploration, Colonization, Building, Refueling, or many others.
~
Automating Missions
Automating Missions
Ships can also be completely automated. This means that they assign missions for themselves.

To automate a ship first select it and then press the 'A' key. To turn off automation just assign a mission to the ship.

When a ship is automated a circular blue arrow appears in the bottom-right corner of the Selection Panel.

Note that ALL ships start the game automated.
~
Missions for Bases
Missions for Bases
Although bases are stationary, they can also have missions.

Base missions can include: building new ships, retrofitting to a new design or scrapping the base when it is no longer needed.
~
Types of Ships and Bases
Types of Ships and Bases
Let's take a look at the different types of ships and bases in your empire.
~
Exploration Ships
Exploration Ships
Exploration ships chart unknown areas of the galaxy. As they explore they reveal colonizable planets, uncover valuable resources and make contact with other empires.

Exploration ships can be automated to explore on their own ('A' key).

To cycle through all of your Exploration ships use the Cycle Colony and Exploration Ships button, or use the 'X' key.
~
Colony Ships
Colony Ships
Colony ships allow you to colonize other planets, founding new worlds for your empire.

The ship is consumed when a new colony is established. The resources from the ship are used to give the colony a kickstart.

While most ships are built at space ports, Colony ships can only be built at colonies.
~
Colony Ships contd.
Colony Ships contd.
To start with you can only colonize the native planet type of your race. But as your research uncovers new technology you can progressively colonize other types of planets.

However you can always colonize planets where there is an existing independent alien population - regardless of the type of planet. In these situations the preexisting population may resist your colonization attempt, with the loss of your colony ship.

To cycle through all your colony ships use the Cycle Colony and Exploration Ships button, or use the 'X' key.
~
Space Ports
Space Ports
Space Ports are bases that provide many important services for your empire. Space Ports must always be built at a colony.

They serve as a central point of trade for your empire. Mined resources are brought here by freighters and mining ships.

Space Ports also provide construction facilities for your empire. Both state and private ships are built here. When private citizens purchase freighters or other ships, your empire earns income.
~
Space Ports contd.
Space Ports contd.
Space Ports also provide other vital functions:
- Heavy weapons provide strong defense for the colony
- Research facilities for your scientists and engineers
- Bonuses that help keep the colony population happy: medical facilities and recreation centres

To cycle through all of your Space Ports use the Cycle Space Ports button, or use the 'P' key.
~
Freighters
Freighters
Freighters transport cargo between colonies, mining stations and space ports. They come in small, medium and large sizes.

Freighters work for your empire, but they are not yours. They belong to the private citizens in your empire. All transportation of goods in your empire is performed by private citizens.

Thus you cannot assign missions to Freighters.
~
Mining Ships
Mining Ships
Mining Ships are mobile resource extraction ships. They mine resources that are in high demand, returning them to your nearest space port.

Mining ships work for your empire, but they are not yours. They belong to the private citizens in your empire.

Thus you cannot assign missions to Mining ships.
~
Mining Stations
Mining Stations
Mining Stations are bases that extract resources from planets, moons, asteroids and gas clouds.

They can be either standard mining stations or gas mining stations.

Mining Stations are built by Construction Ships at resource-rich planets.
~
Construction Ships
Construction Ships
Construction Ships are mobile construction yards. They can build bases at uninhabited planets or even in deep space.

Use the Cycle Construction Ships button to cycle through all the construction ships in your empire, or use the 'Y' key.
~
Military Ships
Military Ships
Military ships defend your empire from enemy empires and from marauding pirates.

They can be assigned the following missions:
- Attack an enemy target
- Patrol a colony or base, watching for attackers
- Escort a civilian ship, such as a construction ship or mining ship

There are various sizes and classes of military ships.

Use the Cycle Military Ships button to cycle through them, or use the 'M' key.
~
Find Idle Ships
Find Idle Ships
You can find ships that don't currently have a mission by clicking the Cycle Idle Ships button (or press the I key).

This helps you find ships that are not being used so that you can assign missions to them.
