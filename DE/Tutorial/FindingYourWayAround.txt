Introduction
Introduction
Distant Worlds is a complex game, but the goal is simple: build and maintain a galactic empire.

In the game you focus on 4 key areas:
- Explore the galaxy
- Colonize new planets
- Extract valuable resources
- Defend your empire

The Galaxy
The Galaxy
The Galaxy is a big place - it's packed with new worlds to find, alien races to discover and resources to exploit.

Let's take a look at how you can move around the galaxy.

The main view shows a portion of the galaxy - in this case a small portion of one star system near one of your colony planets.

Move the mouse pointer to the edge of the screen to scroll the main view up, down, left or right. You can also use the arrow keys on your keyboard to do the same thing.

You can also drag the main view by holding down the right mouse button.

As you zoom out further the main view changes to show systems.

At this level ships and bases are shown as icons. The icon color indicates which empire the ship or base belongs to.

Explored Systems

Systems that you have explored have their names displayed next to them.
~
Unexplored Systems
Unexplored Systems
Systems that you have not yet explored have no name displayed next to them.
~
Colonized Systems
Colonized Systems
Systems that have been colonized by an empire are circled with their empire's color.

The size of the circle indicates the system's relative importance - larger systems are more valuable.
~
Empire Territory
Empire Territory
Systems that are part of an empire's territory have a colored background.

A system can be owned by an empire even when it is not colonized.

Colonies project their empire's influence into nearby systems, making them part of their empire's territory.
~
Independent Systems
Independent Systems
Some systems have independent colonies of aliens that do not belong to any empire.

These independent systems are circled with a solid grey line.

They can be good targets for your empire to colonize - the aliens provide a critical boost to the population of your new colony, allowing it to quickly start earning income for your empire.
~
Systems with Potential Colonies
Systems with Potential Colonies
Any systems with potential colonies are indicated by a dashed grey circle.

Build a new colony ship and send it to these uninhabited planets to establish a new colony for your empire.
