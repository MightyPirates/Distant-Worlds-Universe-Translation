'Multiple labelled lines of information per research project as follows:
'PROJECT: core project information - THIS LINE IS REQUIRED
'COMPONENTS: components that are unlocked by the research project - THIS LINE IS OPTIONAL
'COMPONENT IMPROVEMENTS: improvements to existing components - THIS LINE IS OPTIONAL
'FIGHTERS: new fighter types - THIS LINE IS OPTIONAL
'FACILITY: planetary facility or wonder - THIS LINE IS OPTIONAL
'ABILITIES: new abilities, e.g. ship/base construction size increase, new ship types that can be built, troop improvements, etc - THIS LINE IS OPTIONAL
'PLAGUE CHANGE: change of values for plague defined in plagues.txt, e.g. reduced lethality of plague. THIS LINE IS OPTIONAL

'PARENTS: parent research projects that lead to this project, i.e. the path to this project - THIS LINE IS REQUIRED

'the above lines are explained in more detail below:

'PROJECT line - list of comma-separated values as follows:
' - Project ID: unique numeric value identifying the project
' - Name: text of project name
' - Tech Level: how advanced the project is, which determines the default research cost of the project. This corresponds to the 'column' that this project is displayed at in the tech tree, tech level 0 is at far left, tech level 7 is at far right. Each single additional tech level doubles the default research cost of the project.
' - Row: the vertical position of the project in the tech tree, starting at 1 (top)
' - Industry: 0=Weapons, 1=Energy, 2=HighTech
' - Category: 0=Armor, 1=AssaultPod, 2=Computer, 3=Construction, 4=EnergyCollector, 5=Engine, 6=Extractor, 7=Fighter, 8=Habitation, 9=HyperDisrupt, 10=HyperDrive, 11=Labs, 12=Manufacturer, 13=Reactor, 14=Sensor, 15=ShieldRecharge, 16=Shields, 17=Storage, 18=WeaponArea, 19=WeaponBeam, 20=WeaponGravity, 21=WeaponIon, 22=WeaponPointDefense, 23=WeaponSuperArea, 24=WeaponSuperBeam, 25=WeaponTorpedo, 26=WeaponSuperTorpedo

' - Base Cost Multiplier Override: multiplier factor for modifying the default research cost of the project. Project cost is related to Tech Level - each single additional tech level doubles the default research cost of the project. Base Cost Multiplier Override can be used to make projects more or less expensive than normal.

'FACILITY line:
' - a single PlanetaryFacilityId value. The PlanetaryFacilityId must match a planetary facility or wonder from the facilities.txt file. You can only have a single planetary facility or wonder in a single research project

'ABILITIES line - single research ability comprised of comma-separated values as follows:
' - Name: text of ability name

' - Level: relative level of ability when compared to other abilities of the same type, i.e. the highest ability will be used
' - Value: ability value specific to ability type. Detailed meanings for each ability type explained below:
' -     when Type is 0 (Ship Boarding): value greater than zero defines percentage bonus to boarding attack strength (e.g. 25 means +25% bonus when boarding enemy ships), value less than zero defines percentage bonus to boarding defense strength (e.g. -25 means +25% bonus defending against enemy boarding)
' -     when Type is 1 (Colonize New Planet Type): 1=Continental, 2=Marshy Swamp, 3=Ocean, 4=Desert, 5=Ice, 6=Volcanic

' -     when Type is 3 (Enable New Ship Type): Value is UNUSED
' -     when Type is 4 (Population Growth Rate at planet type): 1=Continental, 2=Marshy Swamp, 3=Ocean, 4=Desert, 5=Ice, 6=Volcanic
' -     when Type is 5 (Troops): for all troop types when value is zero then means Enable new Troop Type, for Infantry, Armored and Special Forces troop types value greater than zero means percentage bonus to attack strength (e.g. 25 means +25% attack strength), values less than zero means percentage bonus to defense strength (e.g. -25 means +25% defense strength). For Planetary Defense troop type value greater than zero defines additional percentage bonus to damage amount against invading troops, value greater than zero defines additional percentage bonus to intercept chance against invading troops
' - Related Object Index: extra sub type for some ability types as explained further below:
' -     when Type is 3 (Enable New Ship Type): 0=Carrier, 1=Resupply Ship
' -     when Type is 5 (Troops): 0=ALL Troop Types, 1=Infantry troop type, 2=Armored troop type, 3=Planetary Defense troop type, 4=Special Forces troop type

' - ID: numeric ID value of plague. Must match a plague defined in plagues.txt file
' - Description: textual description of this plague change
' - MortalityRate: rate of population loss caused by plague, measured in population lost per second. Should be in range between 1 and 100000000
' - InfectionChance: numeric value that determines chance of plague spreading to other nearby colonies. Higher values means higher chance of spreading. Should be in range of 0 to 1000
' - Duration: typical duration of plague at a colony, measured in seconds. Thus a value of 300 means 6 months of game time. Should be in range of 1 to 1200
' - ExceptionMortalityRate: rate of population loss caused by plague for Exception Race in plagues.txt file, measured in population lost per second. Should be in range between 1 and 100000000
' - ExceptionInfectionChance: numeric value that determines chance of plague spreading to other nearby colonies for Exception Race in plagues.txt file. Higher values means higher chance of spreading. Should be in range of 0 to 1000
' - ExceptionDuration: typical duration of plague at a colony for Exception Race in plagues.txt file, measured in seconds. Thus a value of 300 means 6 months of game time. Should be in range of 1 to 1200

'ALLOWED RACES line - filter project to specific alien races, only the named races can research the project. If no races defined then all races can research the project
' - comma-separated list of race names that are allowed to research this project. Each race name must exactly match a race found in the races folder
